# Photo Gallery

This app was made during Launch Schools Core Curriculum. In this project we were supplied with the backend express app and developed the front end of a photo gallery. Users can click through some photos, add a comment, like, and favorite photos. I used jQuery for the event handling as well as ajax to communicate with the backend. Handlebars was used to provide a template for each component of the photos.
